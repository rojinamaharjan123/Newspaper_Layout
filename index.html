          <h3>12 Million COVID Shots Pile Up In Storages
          </h3>
          <p>Even though a large number of anti-COVID-19-vaccine has been coming to Nepal, but, the government has been unable to run the vaccination campaign swiftly. As a result, vaccines are being piled up in storage units across the country.

            Despite the claim of the government that it can inoculate up to 3 lakh people in a day, it has been inoculating around 1 lakh people in a day. Currently, there is a total of 12,099,000 doses of anti-COVID-19-vaccine in the storage units in the province and centre.
            
            According to Dr Krishna Poudel, Spokesperson of the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), 12,099,000 total storage doses of vaccine against COVID-19 are in storage after administering 21,988,516 doses of the total 38,539,367 doses of vaccine that have arrived in Nepal. 
            The remaining 4,451,851 doses of vaccines are not in record because the local levels are administered with their own autonomy.
